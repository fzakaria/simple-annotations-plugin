*Frustrated with using a datasource that doesn't support annotations?*

This is a *simple annotation* plugin for [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) that works with **any** Datasource!

It works by using the `dashboard.json` itself as the store for annotations -- this means that you can easily backup / save / share your annotations.

```json
  "annotations": {
    "list": [
      {
        "datasource": "${DS_SIMPLE_ANNOTATION}",
        "enable": true,
        "hide": false,
        "iconColor": "rgba(255, 96, 96, 1)",
        "limit": 100,
        "name": "Deployments",
        "queries": [
          {
            "date": "2017-09-03T19:56:36.000Z",
            "text": "First Deployment"
          },
          {
            "date": "2017-09-03T20:56:53.000Z",
            "text": "Second Deployment"
          },
          {
            "date": "2017-09-03T21:56:56.000Z",
            "text": "Third Deployment"
          }
        ],
        "showIn": 0,
        "type": "alert"
      }
    ]
  },
```
